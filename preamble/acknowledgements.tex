\chapter*{Acknowledgements} %the star makes the chapter unnumbered
This is a good place to acknowledges those who helped you along the way. \\Also please note how LaTex has put this on a new page as it is a new chapter. No command (apart from starting a new chapter) was needed to do this. \\Also note the lack of number on the title, and contrast this to proceeding chapters, the abstract and acknowledgements should be unnumbered, the proceeding chapters should be numbered.
