No prior knowledge of \LaTeX{} is expected, just take a look around and try to work out how it works! There is lots of documentation in both the source code of this file and the text so I would suggest you look at both while reading! \\(You can get to the source code of this abstract by navigating to preamble/abstract.tex [on Overleaf this is in the file explorer on the left of the page or sometimes you can double click on a word in the document on the right to take you to the place]) %% Hello! this is the sourcecode!
I would suggest you now go and look in main.tex now to understand how the document is laid out.
\\Good luck with your work, I hope this is useful to you!
