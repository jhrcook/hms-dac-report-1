%Packages are included below, these are akin to libraries in other programming languages. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to reduce the number of packages included in a document. It might compile faster, but overleaf compiles fast so this should not be an issue.
\documentclass[12pt,twoside]{report} %tells the compiler that this is a 'report' style document, and the main font size.
\usepackage{setspace} %allows the use of '\doublespace' to set line spacing
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %inclusion of this is optional, overleaf includes it in its compiler so it is not necessary, it may be necessary for other compilers.
\usepackage[english]{babel} %this does a few things eg allowing dates to be made by the compiler. probably best not to get rid of it
\usepackage{wrapfig} %if it is desirable to wrap text (see https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Wrapping_text_around_figures).
\usepackage{graphicx} %this allows graphics to be put in easily
\usepackage{float}%this allows you to put them in good places
\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem} %this is good for chemical reactions
\usepackage{amsmath} %maths package
\usepackage{amssymb} %symbol package
\usepackage{textcomp,gensymb} %more symbols (eg \degree)
\usepackage{appendix} %self explanatory
\usepackage{colortbl} %good for colouring in cells on a table
\usepackage{rotating} %allows you to rotate graphics
\usepackage{bm} %helps bold things
\usepackage{multirow} %for tables
\usepackage{longtable} %for long tables
\usepackage{booktabs} %more tables
\usepackage{pdfpages} %allows PDFs to be included in document (good if you want to include a pdf in an appendix eg)
\usepackage{caption} %allows captions for graphics
\usepackage[nottoc]{tocbibind} %adds the bibliography to the table of contents
\usepackage{subcaption} %allows subcaption for multiple images in one graphic

\PassOptionsToPackage{hyphens}{url}\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{hyperref} %this is great for putting hyperreferences in the document.
\usepackage[table]{xcolor} %more colouring of tables
\definecolor{Gray}{gray}{0.9} %this defines a colour to be used and gives it a name. This is a colour called 'Gray' it is 'gray' with transparency 0.9
\hypersetup{colorlinks=false} %this stops links being colourful, which makes a report look less professional I believe.


\usepackage[letterpaper, top=0.5in, bottom = 0.5in, right = 0.5in, left=0.5in]{geometry} %this describes the layout of the document and the margins etc.
%\doublespacing %self explanatory
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.5}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%For a long report such as a thesis, I would recommend thinking like programming, that is, have a short 'main' and long programs (or chapters in this case) this allows you to access each chapter easily and see the layout of the document easily.
%
%using \input{} basically puts the code specified in the argument (between the braces) into the body of the code in main
