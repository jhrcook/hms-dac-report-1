\chapter{Conclusion}

Recognizing the tissue-specificity of cancer driver genes is essential to precision medicine.
Indeed, the role of an individual oncogene is context dependent and, thus, distinct in each cancer type.
The studies described here investigate tissue-specificity via two mechanisms.
The first aims to characterize the properties of a single gene, \KRAS{}, in multiple contexts including in tissues where it is a potent oncogene and in tissues with built-in resistance.
The second mechanism studies the causes of a change to the cellular context via epigenetic dysregulation.
These two approaches represent a multi-faceted and unique analysis of a phenomenon critical to our understanding of cancer.
