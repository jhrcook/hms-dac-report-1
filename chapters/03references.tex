\chapter{What to do About References}

References in \LaTeX{} can be slightly cumbersome, but it is not too bad. Further reading can be found here \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex}.

\section{Generating and Importing a Reference File}
I would recommend using a reference collating software such as Zotero or any other software that can readily produce a \verb+.bib+ file. In Zotero, on a mac, this is done by exporting the collection (right-clicking on your collection of sources or selecting File $\rightarrow$ Export Collection) and then selecting the format as BibTex.

The \verb+.bib+ file should then be imported into overleaf (using the rightmost of the three icons above the sidebar when editing a document) and called something like \verb+references.bib+.

\section{Citing in Text}

To cite in text, simply import your references file, then use the \verb+\cite{}+ command. Overleaf will then present you with a searchable directory of all the references in the file, and you will be able to place the desired reference at the desired loaction. If you leave all the settings as trhey are in this file, you will get in text citations of the style `\cite{winter_designing_2018}' and the bibliography will be in IEEETR style. 

\section{BibLatex}

I have no experience with BibLatex, but I believe it to be a good option instead of BibTex if you are having trouble. Details can be found here \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX}
