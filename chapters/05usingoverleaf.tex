\chapter{How to Use Overleaf Well}

This chapter briefly covers layout of \LaTeX{} files and file management in Overleaf.

I would recommend doing as I have done in this template, keeping 'main' short, and using longer chapters which are then imported into the main much as functions are called in programming. This reduces clutter and allows you to insert and move chapters easily.

I would also recommend using folders for images, chapters, etc. as this will. greatly clean up. your workspace. A thesis could easily have 100 pages and 50 figures; it is much simpler if these are in smaller chunks, stored in folders.
